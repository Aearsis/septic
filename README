Building for development:

git submodule update --init
make
sudo make rights

Building for deployment (in /opt/septic):

git submodule update --init
echo "install_dir = /opt/septic" > config.local
make
sudo make install
sudo make mkdirs UID=septic
sudo make systemd

When developing the septic framework itself, do not forget to run
'make test' before submitting patches.
